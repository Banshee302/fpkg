# FPKG
The Fedurux Package Manager GitHub Mirror.
**Fpkg is only preinstalled on the currently being developed as of 7/12/2024 FCat-32 Fedurux System! FCat will never support the new Fedurux Libraries being Developed!**

Fpkg main mirror supports GitHub and Mega Mirrors for Packages.


Fpkg v1.0 supports FCat-32 Kernel system and Higher.

# NOTE!
Fpkg is optimized for Fedurux based Systems, it CAN work on Windows and Linux / Unix based Systems, but it may not work the best!

# Source Building
We highly reccomend if you can tolerate it, using the windows powershell installer (or the Shell Installer made for Unix, Lunix and MacOS.) to install, this will simplify the installation process by a million times and you will have to do little to NO maintenance to install Fpkg!, Please note that you do need internet connection to install via the Installer Scripts.

# Installer Scripts
The Installer Scripts are the Overall reccomended way to install the Package Manager, with Source you WILL need to do everything manually.

# Source-Build
(Not Recommended.)

you will need to run a compiling program and building the scripts (painful on windows.) and install it to your computer. (ProgramFiles recommended for Windows Systems.) and you will need to install the keyring and make your own certificate for the package manager, we do not natively provide guides for Source Build as it is not generally supposed to be used for installation but some people prefer it so we provide it, we assume you know what your doing for Source-Build!
